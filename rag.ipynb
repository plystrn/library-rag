    "**1. Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Library is a building or room containing collections of books for people to read or borrow. In library there is usually a librarian to help people on finding books based on their needs. A librarian is expected to have complete understanding of books kept in the library as to help referring people on which book is best for their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the librarian has to read a lot of books to have good understanding of each book and memorize the majority of books to help recommending books to visitor. In recent days, there are fewer people have interest in reading books or being a librarian, this resulting on difficulties finding librarian for a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop LLM to be a librarian who can recommend a book to visitor based on their request or interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Analytical Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "To precisely recommend a book based on the visitor request, we will need to calculate the similarity between the request and our book database. The first step is to create embeddings for our book's content stored in the database. We will use gemini to extract the embeddings and add it into new column in our dataframe. The next step is to extract the embeddings of the query and calculate the similarity by computing the dot product between query embeddings and book's content embeddings. After getting the book with the highest similarity score, we then pass the content of the book into the query we constructed. The query constructed will be the prompt that will be passed into the gemini model and the result will be the book recommended based on the visitor's topic of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will manually evaluate the model by testing several queries including:\n",
    "1. Requesting the book explicitly e.g. 'I want to learn mathematics. Give me book recommendation about it'. The expected output will be book recommendation covering mathematics from our database.\n",
    "2. Requesting the book implicitly e.g. 'I want to learn about integral. Give me book recommendation about it' The expected output will be book recommendation covering mathematics since integral is a part of mathematics.\n",
    "3. Requesting books not in our database e.g. 'I want to learn about law. Give me book recommendation about it.' The expected output will be there are no books in our database covering the topic of law."
